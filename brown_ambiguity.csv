,ca01,,,The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place.
,ca01,,,"The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee, which had over-all charge of the election, `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted."
,ca01,,,The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr..
,ca01,,,"`` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '', the jury said, `` considering the widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size of this city ''."

,ca01,,,The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous ''.
,ca01,,,It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them ''.
,ca01,,,"The grand jury commented on a number of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments ''."
,ca01,,,Merger proposed
,ca01,,,"However, the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration ''."
,ca01,,,"The City Purchasing Department, the jury said, `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies ''."
,ca01,,,It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem.
,ca01,,,Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury.
,ca01,,,It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected ''.
,ca01,,,The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes.
,ca01,,,"`` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program '', the jury said, but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives none of this money."
,ca01,,,The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties ''.
,ca01,,,"Nevertheless, `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '', the jurors said."
,ca01,,,`` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers.

,ca01,,,State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker.
,ca01,,,"In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters."
,ca01,,,"Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended."
,ca01,,,"When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no -- and there were no dissents."
,ca01,,,"The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1"
,ca01,,,"Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot, or 2"
,ca01,,,The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform.

,ca01,,,Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment.
,ca01,,,Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item.
,ca01,,,Construction bonds
,ca01,,,"Meanwhile, it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds."
,ca01,,,"The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act, and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways."
,ca01,,,A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work.
,ca01,,,A revolving fund
,ca01,,,The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities.
,ca01,,,Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin.
,ca01,,,"The Highway Department source told The Constitution, however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds."
,ca01,,,Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances.
,ca01,,,Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought.
,ca01,,,"While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31."
,ca01,,,A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5.
,ca01,,,"As of Sunday night, there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action."
,ca01,,,Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.
,ca01,,,"A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education, something it has consistently opposed in the past."
,ca01,,,"Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education, provided that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds."
,ca01,,,"Barber, who is in his 13th year as a legislator, said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it (the resolution) passed ''."
,ca01,,,But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution.
,ca01,,,"The resolution, which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday, will be formally read Monday."
,ca01,,,"It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '', the State Board of Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises."

,ca02,,,-- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers.
,ca02,,,"Daniel personally led the fight for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation."
,ca02,,,"Under committee rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week."
,ca02,,,But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.
,ca02,,,Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31.
,ca02,,,He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic ''.

,ca02,,,`` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars ''.

,ca02,,,-- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties.

,ca02,,,There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House.
,ca02,,,"It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools, permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here."

,ca02,,,The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22.

,ca02,,,-- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday.
,ca02,,,"Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet of 250 people."

,ca02,,,"The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project."
,ca02,,,Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas.
,ca02,,,"Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway Cotten's attack."
